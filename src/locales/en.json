What else do you want, a settings empire?I added the narrator speed slider because our site tester was aging rapidly while waiting for the lines tofinish. Then I threw in a language selector because i simply can. But making these settings apply to the whole site? Yeah, no. I am way too lazy for that.So that's all you get. Enjoy!"
